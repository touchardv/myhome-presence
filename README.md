# myhome-presence

A web service for querying, managing and tracking family members presence at home.

Please note this is a work-in-progress; I use this project to:

* Continue learning the Go language.
* Experiment with presence detection at home (using IP ping, Bluetooth...).
* Complete my "home" automation/security/... software.
* Have fun.

## Building

Requirements:

* The `make` command (e.g. [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)).
* The [Golang toolchain](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.16 or later).

In a shell, execute: `make` (or `make build`).

The build artifacts can be cleaned by using: `make clean`.

## Running

In a shell, execute: `make run`
